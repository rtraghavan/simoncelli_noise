# Filtered noise generation.
This repository contains a variety of code used to generate filtered noise stimuli. These stimuli are based on those documented in papers with Schrater and Simoncelli ([2000](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10607396),[2001](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11298449)). 

Specifically, the following repositories implement code to generate

a. Spatiotemporally filtered white noise stimuli.
b. Stochastic noise stimuli that expand or contract akin to optic flow via exponential spatial frequency expansion.

TODO:
- add method of pixel noise adjustment to these stimuli
- add deterministic optic flow capacity to the code.
- rewrite all of this in python.
